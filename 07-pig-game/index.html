        <h2>How to Play The Pig Game</h2>
        <summary>
         Players take turns rolling the dice 🎲. Whatever number turns up is added to their current score for the round. If they roll🎲 a one, their current score becomes zero and the next player gets a turn. Players can stop rolling🎲 and 📥Hold that is add their current score to their total score and the next player gets a turn; so as not to lose their points in the case of rolliing🎲 a one. The first player whose total score gets to 100💯 wins the game. Good Luck and Have Fun!!😁😁
